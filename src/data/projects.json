After a deep dive into understanding the mission of the company, we assisted in establishing the name and executing its meaning through an all-around brand identity package and website. We used the concept of the yin and yang to bring together the ‘S’ shape and opposing blue dots. The modern style speaks to the elite and professional level athletes that Symbiotic works with, while still being approachable for their younger audience. The powerful, vibrant aesthetic translates beautifully onto accessories, signage, and more.",
